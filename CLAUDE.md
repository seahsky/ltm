# LTM-Embodied Agent

## Mission

Build a **lifelong hierarchical long-term memory** system for embodied agents,
extending the **ReMEmbR** backbone (Anwar et al., ICRA 2025) and evaluated in
the **Habitat simulator on the HM3D dataset** (Ramakrishnan et al., 2021).

The four core modules — STM, bio-inspired consolidation, hierarchical LTM
(fine / mid / coarse), and memory-guided plan re-ranking — are specified in
`Research Proposal_Embodied Agent.md`.

**Current state.** The code in `dialogue_memory/` is a text-only prototype
that validates the LTM machinery against the MSC multi-session dialogue
benchmark. Results so far: see `MSC_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md`. The embodied port
to ReMEmbR + Habitat/HM3D is the main research goal and is not yet started.

**What's missing for HM3D** (high level): ReMEmbR backbone integration, a
vision-language perception encoder for RGB-D + language observations, a
Habitat env + HM3D scene loader, episode/task definition, and a planning
module that consumes hierarchical retrievals.

## Repo orientation

- `dialogue_memory/` — LTM modules: `ltm.py` (3-layer FAISS memory),
  `consolidation.py` (importance scoring `I = αR + βU + γN`),
  `pattern_cluster.py` (mid-layer), `reranking.py`, `encoder.py`
  (pluggable embeddings), `train_predictor.py`, `train_scorer.py`,
  `msc_benchmark.py` (eval harness).
- `data/` — datasets. Currently MSC; HM3D scenes will land here.
- `run_msc_*.sh` — baseline / quick / full MSC evaluation scripts.
- `Research Proposal_Embodied Agent.md` — method spec (source of truth
  for the research goal).
- `README_LTM_MSC_EVAL.md`, `README_MSC_EVAL.md`, `MSC_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md`
  — dialogue-side architecture notes and early results.

## Conventions

- Method spec lives in the research proposal; treat it as authoritative
  for the embodied design. The dialogue code is reference, not constraint.
- Don't break the dialogue/MSC path while building the embodied path —
  keep them as independent entry points.
